Managing a school or university involves handling students, courses, grades, and teachers. We will create a system that tracks student enrollments, calculates GPA, and manages course data using arrays, objects, functions, and loops.

Scenario: Managing Student Enrollments and GPA Calculation
Weâ€™ll track students enrolled in courses, calculate their average grades, and update their records.
